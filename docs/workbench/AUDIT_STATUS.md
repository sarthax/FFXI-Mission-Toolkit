# Workbench Audit Status

Last updated: 2026-09-25

## Current milestone
Foundation preserved; engine-change workspace audited; C++ API/dependency/build evidence passes are available; a generic canonical SQLite graph store is now implemented; migration classification is now available; feature/package graph integration and validation standardization are next.

## New work completed
- [x] Directly inspected the bundled dsp-engine-changes/_example_change scaffold.
- [x] Confirmed the engine-change convention is README + real scoped diff + verification evidence.
- [x] Added engine_change_index.py for evidence-first indexing.
- [x] Added docs/workbench/ENGINE_CHANGE_AUDIT.md.
- [x] Verified the existing project evidence for a real Lua/C++ API-shape mismatch in GetNPCByID.
- [x] Verified the existing mob_groups logical-vs-physical identity warning and content-duplication safeguard.
- [x] Added generic Function/FunctionSignature/Binding/EnumDefinition records.
- [x] Added conservative external-root C++ API indexing.
- [x] Added standardized AnalysisResult/Finding records.
